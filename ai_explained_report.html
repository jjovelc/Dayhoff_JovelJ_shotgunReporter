                What you’re looking at:  
This chart shows the “alpha diversity” of the different bacterial classes living in your gut – it’s like counting how many distinct types of friends are in your neighborhood and how evenly they’re spread out.

What it means for your health:  
A higher, more balanced number of classes usually signals a healthier gut that can do more jobs (digest food, fight off bad germs, keep your immune system happy).

Why it’s important:  
Knowing where you stand lets you make smart choices—like foods or probiotics—to keep your gut community diverse and strong, which can boost overall wellbeing.
